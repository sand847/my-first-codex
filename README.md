# My First Codex

This repository now includes a simple console-based Snake game using Python and the `curses` module.

## Running the Game

Run the snake game with:

```bash
python3 snake_game.py
```

Use the arrow keys to move the snake. Eat the food (`*`) to grow longer, and avoid crashing into the walls or yourself.
